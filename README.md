# GymScript | BackEnd

This project started as a final project for the “Software Development” course at the UTN FRRO university. The main objective of this project is to create a web application that allows the management of a gym.

It was originally developed by a team of 5 students, after finishing the project, I decided to continue working on it to improve it and add more features. **The original project can be found in this [branch](https://github.com/fraancosan/gymScriptBE/tree/facultad)**
